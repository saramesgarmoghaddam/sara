Computer science is the discipline that seeks to build a scientific foundation
for such topics as computer design, computer programming, information processing,
algorithmic solutions of problems, and the algorithmic process itself.

It provides the underpinnings for today’s computer applications as well as the
foundations for tomorrow’s computing infrastructure.

The goal of this book is to establish a functional
understanding of computer science:

one that will support those who wish to
pursue more specialized studies in the science as well as one that will enable
those in other fields to flourish in an increasingly technical society.
